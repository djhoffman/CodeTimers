<h1> CodeTimers </h1>

<p> In this assignment, I am utilizing the poetry timer code to make a rainbow and pink themed project. You can drag the mouse around for a rainbow solid color, or rotate the potentiometer to get the text to go faster or slower. It will automatically go back and fourth from pink to rainbow. </p>
